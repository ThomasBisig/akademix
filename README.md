This is the repository for the project hosted on www.akademix.ch

## What it is (or will be)

akademix.ch is a open, non-linear learning plattform, which starts
- with topics on physics and math
- with exercises as the foundation, more learning material later
- in german first, maybe other languages later

## How it is developped

The plattform is meant to be built
- slowly (5h per week)
- in the open
- just by myself so far
