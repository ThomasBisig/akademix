[notice=tip]
Project Guidelines:
- accessible (markdown, opensource)
- simple (structure, language)
- reusable (images, texts)
- building in the open
[/notice]

General idea exercises:
- Every exercise has (at least) two versions at the same difficulty (just different numbers/inputs), simple linking between these two.
- Every exercise has "Kurzantwort, Lösungsidee, Lösungsweg"
- Solutions are 'worked solutions'
- Exercise has tipps/hints
- Necessary concepts are linked in solution
- Every exercise should have more and less difficult options (two)
